# Drosometer

Drosophila melanogaster most frequently known as fruit flies are an excellent model system for a genetic analysis The time span of this fly is about 5 hours and is closely related to human being so the experiment which we canâ€™t try on human can be performed on this fly and since it has time span of 5 hours so you can get the results in less time. Drosophila has won 3 Nobel prizes. Bu the problem is it takes usually single day or several hours to classify the new specie and to calculate the features of this fly. Our doctor who is currently doing his research uses different patterns of wings and eyes color of these flies to classify to which family it belongs and this whole process is performed by the naked eyes of the doctor. Putting all that in mind, this decision-based system aims to bring solution to this problem that whenever a new fly comes so our system would classify that to which family it belongs and calculates its features in just one click.
