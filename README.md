The main aim of this project is to provide new perception for the doctors to shift from Manual Work to Automation. This system will allow our users to work on the flyâ€™s wing and eyes. All the features of the wing and eye will be calculated automatically in few minutes and in the end the report will be generated to our users which would be providing insights of those features.
