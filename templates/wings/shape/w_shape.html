                    <br>


                    <p align="justify">Drosophila flies are a widely used model organism in genetic and developmental studies, and the
                        ability to accurately detect and classify mutations is crucial for further research. With this
                        module, researchers can quickly and easily identify and classify mutations in their flies,
                        streamlining their research process and allowing for more targeted investigations into the
                        underlying genetic and developmental processes.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p align="justify">The mutation detection and classification process is powered by a combination of advanced
                        image processing algorithms and machine learning models, ensuring high accuracy and
                        reliability. </p>

                                if the fly is normal or if it exhibits any mutations. If the fly is mutated, the

                                can further classify the type of mutation that is present.</p>
