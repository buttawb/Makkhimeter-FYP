                <h1>Fly Classification</h1>
                <p>Here you can identify the fly thats either it's <strong> normal </strong>or <strong>mutated </strong>fly
                    with the help of a wing.</p>
                <bR>
                <p><strong>Mutations </strong> are neither good nor bad: some may be beneficial for an organism; others
                    may be lethal. By creating new gene versions, mutations are a driving force for changes in
                    evolution, sometimes leading to new species.</p>

                    <p>Biologists learn about the proper function of any gene by studying mutations. If a defective gene
                        causes short wings, for instance, scientists know that the healthy version of the gene is
                        responsible for correct wing formation. </p>
